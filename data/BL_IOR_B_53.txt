before the Generall Court, for their further direction therein, which Report-
is in the words following: Viz?
In


BL_IOR_B_53_0117
52.
Report of the payment of the Dividendr
but twice a year approved.
Il pursuance of the Order of Court of the 4th instant, We Ther
Committee of The Treasury have considered of what we think propol,
to be offered to The Generall Court, as Reasons for altering the m
times of Payment of the Annuity, and Dividend to the ense on
Adventurers, which hither to has been quarterly, and for making
the same hence forward onely twice a Year: Piz: At Midsummer
and Christmas, And do thereupon give our opinion as follows:
Vie"
That upon consulting Mr. Dodd The Company’s Connell
We find he is of opinion There is nothing either in the Act of mar
Parliament, or Charter, to oblige The Company to make the said
Payments Quarterly.
That in the present method of Quarterly Payments It i
appears to Us severall inconveniencyes have ensued: Viz?
The shutting up The Transfer Books every Quarter for a
Month, or thereabouts, at a time, in order to take the Ballance of
every Adventurers Stock, and make out the Dividend Warrant
thereon, besides the time annually required at the New Election
is a great prejudice to many of the Adventurers.
By such frequent taking the Ballances, of The Stock an
Bookes, the Principall Officers in the Accomplants Office an
taken off from, or else delayed in executing other Affairs of
The Company, which are of great importance, And particularly
in the Months of March, and September, when the Company lo
Sales commence, and the Buyers in a continued hast to clear
their Goods, And at the end of those Months, when the Interest
on the Companyes Bonds is demandable, and the casting up the
Interest, and making out Parrants for paying it, creates a constit
hurry, and great uneasieness to the Persons concerned when not si
speedily dispatcht.
That if The Annuity and Dividends were payable only
ervice a Year: Diz: At Midsummer, and Christmas, the afore
mentioned in conveniencyes would in a great measure be prevent i
All which is nevertheless submitted to the further determination
of this Court.
