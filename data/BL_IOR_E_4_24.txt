trading to the East Indies.
May it please your Honours. 2
We take this Opportunity of Writing
a few Lines as it is not improbable there may be a lessel
-under Dispatch for Europe from the Presidency of Fort
St George from whence this Setter will be forwarded to your
Honors.
The Hardwich Capt John Sanion and the
the 30 June with your Commands of the 3. August t
November 1757 By the last of which the Government or
this Presidency was put in Rotation confered on Mess:
Watts Manningham, Becher & Holwell.
In Consequence of those Orders Mr
Watts took his Seat in Council as President; But as the
Gentlemen who were appointed to preside alternately,
conceived that many Inconveniences would arise by that
Plan of Government at this Juncture of the Rotation
ordered in your Commands of the 11th November would be
very prejudicial to the Company’s Affairs in Bengal as
they are now Circumstanced, They moved the Board to give
that


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0004
that Affair a serious Consideration & recommended to them a
Deviation from those Orders for many weighty Reasons when
your Honors will find entered at large upon the Face of our
Consultation of the 26th June, those Reasons appearing to the
Board to have great Weight in them We concurred in their
Sentiments & unanimously requested Colonel Clive to access
of the Presidentship of the Company’s Affairs in Bengal
till your Honors think proper to appoint one Yourselves.
Copy of the abovementioned Consultation of 26th June: We ene
for your Observation & beg leave to refer Ourselves there to for
the Particulars of our whole Proceeding in this Affair
We flatter ourselves the Reasons urged
in the abovementioned Consultation will appear sufficiently
solid to your Honors to justify our setting aside your
Directions in so important a particular, to which We sh
have paid the utmost Deference of most ready Obedience,
had the Company’s Commercial Concerns alone been in
Question, but as the Treaty with the Nabob Your Influen
at the Durbar by the late Revolution were Circumstances
the highest Consequence and which your Honors were not
acquainted with when the Hardwick left England. We the
our Duty to our Employers made it incumbant on us to of
them the first Place in our Attention, and as nothing would
have weakened that Influence more than the Rotation or
in your Commands of Hardwick & by that means have
rende


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0005
in
ANON
have
ende
3
rendered the Completion of the Treaty itself precarious, We have
ventured to alter your Appointment till We hear further from
your Honors or till a President is appointed in the usual
Method, which We hope will meet your Approbation.
It is with the greatest Concern We have
heard of the loss of Fort St. David, the Particulars of this
Affair you will be informed of more fully by the President
& 6th of Fort St. George.
As soon as We heard of this Poss He gave
Directions to our Subordinates and the Gomastats employed
at the durings to encrease the ordinary Sortments of their
respective Investments that We might in same Measure
make up for the Disappointment the loss of sort St. David
will probably occasion in the Investments from the Coast
We have not as get been able to station
the Ships now in the River, as the President & 6 of Fort
St George have not informed to if they shall want one in
September to be filled up & finally dispatched for Europe
from their Presidency, should they be in no Want of a
Thip for that Purpose. We shall dispatch the Retenter full on
laden from hence as early in the Season as it is prudent
for her to leave the River We hope to be assisted in the
Dispatch of another Ship by the surplus Topper at Fork
Malbro, of which the daily expect to receive Advice from
the Coast.


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0006
The Nabol of these Provinces is now in
Calcutta upon a Visit to the Governour. We are at present
on the best of Terms with him I have no Reason to complain
of his Want of Rinctuality in the Performance of his Agreement
with Us. The Country enjoys a profound Franquility, &
We have not the least doubt but it will continue so, provided.
We are properly supplied with Troops from Europe conforman
able to our repeated Instances, Turncaws are given Us for the
Remainder of the Monies due to us by the Treaty, a We are
allowed to collect in the Revenues of Burdwan Nudea & other
Places without any Intervention of the Governments Officers
till the Ballance of what is due to is is discharged in full
Since writing thus far Cap Barton
arrived from Madrass with two Setters from the President & C
of Fort St. George by which We find they have determined to
dispatch the Grantham to your Honors with the Bales they
have on hand this makes it unnecessary for us to send up a
Ship in September to the Coast We shall therefore load the
Alchester fully from hence & dispatch her as early in the Sear
as possible.
We have the Pleasure likewise to learn by the Setters
from Port St. George that there will be near 700 Sons of sun
Pepper this Season at Bencoolen, which will assist us in
returning two of the Coast & Bay Ships in case the have n
Tonnage this Season than our Investments require.

Country, has wrote us that the French are dispossessed or
almost every thing but assulapatam & that Monsieur
Bussy is at Cariance with the Morattoes. He have in
Consequence of this Advice desired the President & Co. of Fort
S George to send a servant from that Presidency to Visaga.

naming a rotation of Governours, for the future conduct of
Affairs at this settlement, and having duely weight the nature
of this regulation with all its attending Consequences a sincere
conviction of its being in our present situation and circumstance
repugnant to the true interest of our Hon Masters and the

welfare of the Company at this settlement in the highest de
gree depends, The difficulties we may be liable to be a rotation
in the executive part of Government with its Consequencies are
sufficiently obvious in our present state of Affairst however them
shall only mention a few point. The treaty with the Nabot
not perfect in all its branches, the possession of the lands
in compleat the selement in no posture of defence the
French considerably reinfored with Military a fleet and
their designs with respect to Bengal unknown the imposse
bility of impressing a proper idea of this divided power in the
minds of the suball and other in this Kingdom who have

Gentlemen
I have rect your letter of this D
Date & cannot sufficiently express the grateful senses
have of the favourable Opinion you are plead to ex
sain of me the which has indied you to desire me
acceptance of the Presidency at this critical time
Tho I think shave Cause to be de
tiotye with the Court of Directors for laying me avided
their new form of Government without any reason
Assigned after having named me as Head of the Gener
Committee in the letter of the 3 Angt last yet anima
by the noble Example of publick Spirit which you
have set me I have determind to Wave all private
Considerations where the General good is concerned to
as there is no doubt that the Government of a sing
Berson involved as We are now with the Country lad
must have infinite advantages over the Complice
form of Government established from home. I shall
that motive the both my Health and private
como strongly require my returning to Europe acce
the Offer you have done me the honour to maker
till such time as our Employers have appointed
President in the usual Storm-
I cannot on it testifying my al
nowledgment Gentlemen to you all in general o
Zeal you have discoverd for the service of our Maste
on this occasion but in particular to you who he
been nominated in the rotation of Governour t
have made such a sacrifice that few if any In
can be shown of the like you have of your own
accord parted with the dignity of Government an
alt the advantages the reunts annerd because it
apprehended that the Company’s affairs cond ho
property conducted under a Government so constituted
Unequal as I am to the Weighty t
of directing this Presidency especially in civil matte
to which I have never been able to give due attentio
on acco of my Military Avocations I am now Gent
to beg the assistance of your advice and hope you it
here were in the real you have hither to so a bundantly one
and that none of you but more especially Mr Wats
can render me considerable sources from his thou
knowledge of the Boliticks of the Country will ent
a thought of leaving me will affairs are finally dete

that two of the Ships sent with Troops to the

for the Affairs of the Houble
East India Company
Honble Sir
Our last address was under date the
2th March and the Governor & Council wrote the Court
of Directors the 26th of August last advising you of the
Alteration they thought proper to make in the Go-
vernment here. We now lay hold of the Opportunity
of a Dutch lessel to acquaint you with an Expedition
we have undertaken in the Deckan Country, but an
the Conveyance is uncertain & the notice we re
but short we must beg leave to defer descending
Particulars till the dispatch of our own ships.
tThe President having had infor
tion that Mons: Bussy was much involved it
bles in the Province of Golcondah and received the
ed letter from the Principal Rajah of those Coun
requiring our Assistance the judged we could not
Effectually serve our Employers than by lending at
ard to bring about arevolution in those Parts
5
The removing the Perench for
Golondate from whence they have drawn immen
resourses during the whole War I has long been a pro-
cipal object of the Companys attention, the therefore
thought it our indispensable duty to embrace sofa
vorable an Opportunity and flatter ourselves with
the Force


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0028
the force we have sent We shall be able if not wholl of
extirpate the Enemy from the Province to distri
them so Considerably as to render the Possession
of little use to them,
We have indeed in a manner dro

thought my Commission of Commander in the

and the situation of Your Affairs required
my marching up the Country, I did not

Both the Alchester & Worcester havin
been aground in their outward Bound Passage, ther

Immediately after their Depart

upon the first Notice, Intending to have sent them into Ballar
Road for the Protection of our Trade had the Report above
mentioned been confirmed from good Authority, but as
We heard no more of the lessell which was supposed to be
a French Cruiser, our Orders to the Commanders of the
Alchester Worcester went no further.
Upon a Report delivered in but the
Master Attendant that the Fort St George Mop was
want of more Repairs than she was in reality worth
that the Dragon Hoop purchased at Sutter was not ap
of riding in Ballavore Road, He ordered him to part the
both up to Sale the s0 April, to sell them to the heaper
bidder, which was accordingly performed & the amount
what they sold for has been brought to your Credit and
Wedderburn’s Acce
On the 24th April imported in than the
The Parall Stoop Cape Samuel Elliott, a small Veter
freighted by the Gentlemen at Fort Malbro to committe
“Advices to the President & Council of Fort St. Georg
That Vesel had left Bencoolen in January but matter
able to fetch to Windward of Madrass & being in great
Want of Rovisions & Water, the Master of her thought it
more eligible to bear away for this Place: We supplyed him
with Stores & Provisions & advanced him at different times
1000 Arcot Rupees, intending to have dispatched her in Alice
to the


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0042

to the Coast with the Bencoolen Packett, but just as We
were on the point of dispatching her, the Master wrote
a letter to the Board informing as She had brake from
her Moorings, had lost all her Anchors, her Mast &
sprit. I had likewise received much Damage in her
Hull, to repair which would require a great deal of time
& Expence: Whereupon We thought it adviseable to did
her from the Company’s Service, as she was an usell
Charge to them, Duplicate of her Packett having been
received at Madrass sometime before by the Dicke
The Fanny now which had been
sent to Achin & the Streights of Malacca for Intelliger
returned hither on the 5th June with Information, The
French Ships or Vessells had been seen or heard of on to

Enemy’s Fleet advancing up the River. A Sloops an

The Boats & Combustibles were purchased below the

In the Month of March We regul

how far they would be assisting in the Dispatch of an
of the Shipe to Europe this Season and whether it was
be a greable to them to have one of the Ships then int

Information the found it unecessary to station a se

having desired the Board to give the Commanders of the

Report which is entered after our Consultation of the

London to fill up with Pepper at Bencooler & should have
-made the same Appointment of the Warren, if Capt. Glover
had not informed us, it was necessary to heave her down,
which will detain her too late in the Season
Since writing thus far the Alchester

Fort S. George to be filled up & finally dispatched t
Europe from that Presidency
We had determined before upon a

Your Honours will find by our

of the Grantham had objected on the Bill of Sadin
to the Neight of the Copper laden on that Ship & as your
Honours had acepted the Bill upon those Terms, I had
not wrote us anything concerning it. We were of Opinion
that in Justice We could not insist upon Capt Oliver
-paying for the Deficiency, & therefore delivered up the
Bill of Pading Capt Hume applied tous by letter
to have the amount of his Deficiency referred to Cover
as the Copper turned out right in Tale, which We e

plied with the Short weight of it being but trifline
By the enclosed account sales of
Broad Cloth & Copper made the 18 June you t
observe those Articles have sold at a very hit

which are still in great Demand; He mi

We have given the strictest Attenti
to prevent the Clandestine Importation of illicit
Commodities by the Commanders & Officers of your
Ships, that the Nature of the Affair would admit of
by ordering all Sloops & Boats with private Trade
to be examined & inspected by the SW H. or people
employed by him before the Goods were suffered be
be landed with several other Regulations of which
We gave you advice in our letters of last Season:
Your Honors may depend on over using our utmost Endear
ours to prevent the Communders Officers of your Ships
from Sanding more than your Permission & Indulgene
allows of and We hope the Establishment of a Custom
Master with Warehouses for that Purpose will more
effectually put a Stop to such Practises.

these Inconveniences will always arise from having

the Prices will be enhanced at the durings on account
of the Multiplicity of Purchasers, And the Gomastakes
employed for the Company will find it more difficult to

of a great number of Weavers, provided the could previe

We shall next proceed to recite the

with our Subordinates, beginning with Cossimble
to which Factory Mr Wilder went up in the
beginning of March to put in Execution your
Instructions to him in regard to the winding
off the Raw Silk.
On the 16 of that Month We rece
a Petter from him on that Subject wherein amb
other things he recommended that a sett of the
be constantles kept in the Company’s Pay & the
House be built on the Riddapar for the Resider
of a Covenanted Servant that the Investments
Silk made there might be conducted under the le
of an European of that he himself would go out
for a short time in order to instruct the People
the Method of winding of the Company’s Site
so as to prevent the frequent Complaints of the
from Europe.
The Gentlemen at Cofoimbi

the same Measures as the most likely meant
getting the Company’s Silk wound off a greate

your repeated Firections. We in reply to their letter
permitted them to retain in the Company’s Par
such a Number of Winders as they judged proper
X to build a Bungaloe on the Riddapar for the Resi
:dence of a Junior Servant to make the Silk Invest
-ment there.
As Mr Wilder came out with your
Orders to alter and amend the present Method of winding
off the Silk produced in this Country & as it would have
been very tedious & a great Delay to their Business, for
him to have made his Representations first to the Board
before he put his Plans & Designs in Execution: We
desired that Gentleman to law any Poverals he
might have to offer on the Subject of Silk before the Counce
of Cossimburar who being on the Spot must be the best
Judges how far those Proposals were practicable &
would accordingly see them executed if it could be
-performed. At the same time We enjoined the Gentleme
at Cossimbusar to give the strictest Attention to Mr. Wilder
Proposals of use their best Endeavours to make the
Werders comply with his Instructions of the Methodored
might recommend. We directed them likewise to give him
all the Assitance in their Power whenever he should be
in want of it, either from his Ignorance of the Panguage
or any other Account

The Gentlemen at Cosimburar in t

taken your Orders concerning that Factory into their
serious Consideration, & that they esteemed the followe
Methods for Conducting their Business might be to
with Advantage to the Company. First. That three
Gomástako be appointed for the Provision of silk Perce
Goods. Next that three others be sent to the Curungs
where Gurrahs are manufactured for the Provision

In our answer to the beforement.

Investment of Gurrake of Silk piece Goods by mean
of Gomastats was so conformable to your Honors
Orders and our own Practice, that We could not but
greatly approve of it Laccordingly directed them to
put that Plan in Execution.
As We had disapproved of any
publick Application to the Purbar for a Perwan
to Interdict the Surdars from winding off Silk a
their own Houses. The Gentlemen at Cosses in Con
rence with the Dutch Factory & the principal Me
of the Place have entered into a General Agreement
signed by all Parties, "That none should in futur
give any silk to be wound off by the Surdars at
own Houses", Which Agreement they have hoped
-produce the desired Effect, and enable them to pro
a sufficient Number of Winders for the Company’s
Investment.
In a Letter of the 6th June the
Gentlemen at Cossimburar informed us that the
Ritney reced from the late Natrol Surajud Cou
was on acet of the agreement abovementioned (retur
by the Surdars on their Hands, and it being imple
to attempt the minding it off without Causing a
desertion of their Winders, They requested our Fire

at Outery, it being unfit for the Company’s Use, In
answer to which we directed them to get it wound off
fit for private Trade if it was found impracticable
to wind it off properly for Europe; But that if it
could not be done without impeding the Business
of the present year: We ordered them to send the
Putney down to Calcutta, But soon after We
countermanded the sending of it to Calcutta, as
We were Convinced it would not sell here for any
thing, the Putney being old and a sortment that
Winders of this Place are not used to, for which
Reasons We ordered the Gentlemen at Cossimburar,
to sell it there at Outery if it could not be wound of
fit for private Frade. It has accordingly been sole
and the Amount brought to Credit at that Factory-
The Gentlemen at Cessimburar
having pressed us frequently for Supplies of Treasure
they were directed by the Board in August to send
is an Estimate of the Quantity of Goods He might
expect from that Factory this season. To which they
replied that it was impossible for them to send us an exac
Estimate of the Investment they should be able to make
this Year: But in general they in formed us, that there
should be able to compleat their Orders for Gurrahs
& Silk Piece Goods, but should fall greatly short in the
Silk.


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0062

In a letter of the 30 August they
observed to us that the Silk piece Goods dispatched see
days before were good in general, & particularly the
Fingee Romals which they could with Justice say are
to any sent for many Years, That they flatter themself
likewise the Silk will be more favourably reed by your
Honour than what was formerly sent, as the Cvild
much complained of are in some Measure rectified.
should that nevertheless not be quite compleat in to
respect They assure as it does not proceed from all
Inattention or want of Diligence in them.
Under date the 14 July the Got
"men at Cosimbusar acquainted to that upon
examining the Accounts of Rissenunish the Con
Gomastate, they had found great Reason to suspe
him guilty of several Prands in the managemen
the Investments that they had already detected
in giving in false Acets for the year 1756, in while
he had overcharged 8 127 Re in the real Cost of
Goods provided by him. That they were then upon
Strict Scrutiny into his Act for the last year, of th
Result of which they should afterwards advi
but that in the mean time as they had discovered
ficient to prove him unfit for the Trust hither
reposed in him, they requested our Orders in to

manner they should act for the getting in the remainer
part of the Investment, that they were afraid to take
Charge of it into their own Hands would cause great
Confusion in their Acct & render their Investment
greatly defective, & to continue Kissenundah in his
employ till the end of the Season, might prove a
great Prejudice to the Company; They repeated their
Request therefore for our Orders how to act.
In our reply to that Setter We left
it to them to act in such a manner as they might
judge most Conducive to the two great Crets, Von
To be carefull the Company’s Money was not
emberled or their Employer defrauded by false
Accounts, and that their Privestments might
not be defective either in Quality or Quantity, what
Measure would best Effect those Ends, we could
not be such good Judges of as they who were on the
Spot, for which Reason We left them at Liberty to
do as they thought proper-
We have nothing to adding
this Factory, but that We have supplied it this Near
d. 5. Gold Mohurs
from time to time with 9, 23,353 129 6 Rupees, for carrying

acquainted your Honors of the Perwannah we had
obtained of the Nabob for the sole Purchase of Petre
in the Province of Bahar, which has been a very
considerable Benefit to our Employers, as We shall by
that means not only secure a sufficient Quantity for
the Company’s several Uses at a very low Price, but
shall get a large Profit on the surplus Quantity We
–propose to spare the Dutch Company, & will make
the Patna Factory prove one of the most profitable
Establishment in these Provinces.
The Cloth manufactured at that
Factory will likewise be procurable on much more
reasonable terms than We have been able to get it
for some Years past. We have recommended it to
Mr Amyall of his Council to exert themselves in
that Branch of their Business, I have hopes then
will be able to send down a good Investment of
Cloth the ensuing Season.
In the list of Goods to be provided
in Bengal transmitted of Warren & London, your
Honours have forbid our sending home any Patna
Baftaes. As We imagine that was owing to the high
price formerly paid for that sortment. We have
directed the Gentlemen at Patna to send us Musters
of their Baftaes & to inform us of the lowest prices

Markells in his Progress. The Result of his Enquir
ries our furthur Proceedings will be given in full
under the head of Revenues. In this place We shall
only mention that it being strongly recommended
by that Gentleman to indeavour to procure the
Zemidarry of the Grounds to the Norward of
Calcutta as high as Banquebazar Mr Hastings
who resides at Morandbang in the same Capacity
Mr Scrafton did) was directed by us to endeavour to
get the Nabob to include the Lands to the Northevard
of Calcutta in his Sunnud, which by his lettero,
the 1st December he informs us is at last & after much
Tifficulty settled & adjusted of the Ground betwixt
Banquebazar & Calcutta declared to belong to the
Englich. But notwithstanding this Intelligence
We shall not esteem it secure till the Sunnua
has passed the Forms of is sealed, When We receive
the Grant properly Authenticated, We shall acquaint
your Honors of the Advantages We expect will
accrue to the Company from the Possession or
those Sanas. A tract of land to the No. of
Calcutta belonging to the Pergunnah of Annerpoor
has been likewise applied for in order to square
the Companies Boundaries, which Mr Hastings
in his


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0074

in his foregoing Setter gives us hopes he shalle
able to include in the Sunnud.
Before We quit this Subject
may be proper to take notice that after writing
the above We received a letter from Mr Hade
dated the 6th Deer acquainting is that upon the
pressing the Nabob to confirm & order a Sund
for the Company’s Funds, he started somet
:tions to passing the Grant, alledging that the
Sands obtained by the Company greatly call
his Agreement, That he knew of no Pimitate
upon of that he had only promised to grant the
Company a tract of Sand, the Revenues who
should amount to a Jack of Rupees gift
otherwise expressed in the Treaty it was out
to the Treachery of Roydoolab who had decell
him in it. That he made at the same time &
Objections to the Addition of Annerpoor to the
Company’s Semidarree & offered instead the
to give them the Waddadarree of that Perout
But in the Sequel of Mr Hastings his
We have the pleasure to learn that the Nable
Objections were removed by the Intervention

That the Nabob had not only quitted his Pretensions
but ordered the Rouran to draw up the Sunnud in
the Terms already agreed upon, which was begun
She hoped in 2 or 3 days would be finished, Bur
that he had been obliged to drop the Affair of the
Annépoor Pergunnah to prevent the Sunnuds being
delayed, the Nabob not seeming yet inclineable to allow
of that Grant (being only willing to give the Compan
ny the Wada or Farm of that Peraunnah:
We shall now make a Recital or
our Fransactions relative to the Moneys due
from the Government account the Treaty made
with the present Nabob I shall begin with the
Sales of Sewells, Cloth & Gold received in par
Payment. Such of the Cloth as was fit for the
Company’s use was taken on their Account at the
valuation We received it from the Nabob, & sent
home by last Year’s Shipping, The rest has been
sold at outery of which We gave publich Notice
two Months before the Sales. The Jewells were
likewise advertised for Sale two or three Months
before the day of the Outery which begun the 15th Sun
He even gave Notice of it to the President & Council
of Port St. George, that they might advertise our Intente
to the Inhabitants of that Place. The Acc2 Sale both

By a Brusal of Mr Scrafton
letters received in January & February last of
Honours will find that he requested our Permer
to take Bills on sundry Persons at Dacca & Pit
poor in favour of the Gentlemen at those Tall
for such Sums of Money as the Government it
desirous of giving Drafts for in part of the 1

which he assured As there would be no Rish

in favour of the Gentlemen settled at those Factory
as We knew they would be in want of Money for
carrying on their Business of the Risk of sending
it up by Water Curriages would by this means be
saved. The amount of Bills drawn upon Dacca was Sicca
Rupees
and upon Suchy poor for Sicca R.
the whole or at least the greatest part of
which has been punctually discharged by those the
Bills were drawn upon.
A Tuncaw being given by the Nabor
on the Phowedar of Highley for about 5 lack of Rupees.
and the latter refusing the Payment thereof, the Colonel
of Mr Watts laid the Affair before the Nabob & desire
Payment of that Money by some means or other
It was accordingly settled by a Tuncaw on Ramna:
rain for 200000 Rup & a promise of discharging
the rest out of the Treasury on the Return of the Troops
to Muxadavad. The amount of Ramnarains Tuncaw
was paid at different times to the Gentlemen at Patna
& the remaining 300000 Rupt received in Specie
at Muxadavad.
Upon this Subject We have only to
add that the first years payment has been settled
by the Nabob & most part of the Money for which
Tuncaws were given us received, We have received

Inorder to give your Honours a

In this Place We beg leave to apar
for a Fransaction of which you were made acquite
in our general Setter of Maltro, Viz, the advance
teventy Pack of Rupees to the Navy & Army for
Moiety of the Moner then due to them by virtue
the Subahs Gift: But as the Motives which pro

fully stated as they ought to have been; and all
assent to that Proposal will probably appear to
Honours a very indiscreet Sep. We shall herein
the particular Circumstances which swayed
to comply with the urgent Request of the Adr
the Navy Commanders, grely on your excuse
that Affair should our Proceeding in it appear
way blameable & precipitate. It must then be
:bered that at the time this proposal came from
Admiral & Commanders of the Squadron We were
alarmed with Reports which seemed to be well
grounded, that the French were in Expectation
a large Force from Europe, If that Force arrived
India, It was Evident the Company’s Possesse
in all Parts would be endandered but those in
more than any of the rest, because of the defence

Condition of our Works & the Weakness of our Military
Strength which had been excessively reduced through
Sichness & Casualties, Our whole Dependance therefore
was in the Assistance of the Squadron, & if the Com
"manders of that Squadron had been disgusted by
our Refusal, the Consequences might have been
very dangerous to the Company’s Interest. Before
We returned the Admiral any positive answer to
his Request, We received the certain Intelligence
that a French Fleet had put in & landed a large
Body of Men at Pondicherry, & that six of their
Ships were actually sailed to the Northward
We leave it to your Honours to judge whether under
such Circumstances it would have been prudent
to have disgusted not only the Commanders but
the inferior Officers & private Men of the Squadron
who were all made to think that it was but reasonable
the Governor & Council should advance their Propor.
tion of the Moiety (then due from the Nabob) on account
of their singular Services in retaking Fort William
& giving up all title to the Effects found therein
The Board however took no notice of the Admiral’s
first Application, but a second letter being wrote
them to the same purpose, they were under a
Necessity of giving some Answer, and for the
Reasons


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0082
81
Reasons abovementioned added to the great Rist
the Company would have at this Settlement
so much ready Money laying in the Treasur
which would be utterly lost in case the place
into the Enemy's Hands, We agreed to offer the
Navy & Army Erventy Peaks of Rupees for the s
ety of their Donations then due from the Nabob. A
Company would by this means have had a blate
the Subish of these Provinces, even should the Sell
ment be lost. We judged the making such at
Advance would be attended with no extraordin
Risque, but rather secure the Company som
Money in case of an Accident, for on one side
the money laid in the Treasury & the Place
fallen into the Hands of the Enemy, The wit
was lost without a Possibility of recovering it
while on the other hand an Assignment from
Navy & Army on the Government for the A
at that time due to them, would have been
valid Demand, & might have been claimed
probably recovered from the Subah; whenever
English were settled again in these Provinced
provided a sufficient Number of Troops wered
to enforce the Demand.

Reference to our Consultations in October 1757 that
they not only refused this Offer of ours, but in their
Petters treated the Board in a manner very unber
coming either Themselves or is: finding our Offer
as beforementioned with a further Proposal to refer
it to the Company to allow them more if thought
reasonable so to do) was not at all acceptable, & being
-very apprehensive of the Consequence of giving
Offence to those on whom our Safety at that
Juncture depended so much. We left it to them
to propose their own Terms which (in the Circum-
stances We were then under We must have acquies.
ced with, but this Offer was likewise rejected with
great Cartness of Expression, & Indecency of Sile,
Whereupon all Correspondence upon that point
was dropt for a time, I would never have been revived
by us, But their Agents attending the Board to
settle the amount of their Proportion of Jewells,
Gold & Cloth received of the Nabob, once more started
the Subject of an Advance for the Moiely at that
time due to the Navy & Army, and as they had
Authority from their Principals to accept of our
former Proposal of 20 laaks. We assented for the
Reasons before recited to make them the Advance of
Twenty Laaks of such Rupees as We had received
from
a

from Muxadavad in full for their Moiety of the

will be some Extenuation of the Fault, being
solely guided by our Regard for the Interest t

they have about 700 Connys more in Jungul.

they have already experienced by a great number

A. Dutch Vessell in the Month
of May foundering in Ballasore Road the Master
of her pretended the ship was lost for want of any
Pilots being in the Road, which he deposed before
the Council at Hughly, who addressed the Board
upon the Subject & transmitted them a protest from
the Onners of the Ship with an Estimate of the
Damage sustained by her Poss, desiring us to reimburse
them that Sum, as the Vessell was actually lost by
means of the Restraint We had laid their Pilots &
Hoops under of not asing into the Road. As this
Pretence appeared to us very frivolous, when We
had a Sloop or two of ours in the Road, the Plot
of which had Directions to bring in Dutch Ships
upon the same terms as our own, And as We had
made the Director & 6 at Hughley an Offer of
taking two or three Dutch Pilots on board of our
Hoops, in case they did not think fit to entrust
those in our Service with the Care of their Ships
which they had declined accepting, We could not
look


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0088

look upon the Company to be answerable for the
Accident which had happened to the Thip alread
mentioned or for any Consequence of the same
which might happen in future, as it was on
owing to their own Obstinacy in not accepting
the above Offer: This We acquainted them in
answer to their Letter. Sometime atter they to
a second Application for redress which being to
to the Select Committee, Mr Ales: Scott the B
who was in Ballasore Road at the time the I
Ship was lost) was examined & declared the
lay in the proper Channel for all Vessells commit
& that if the Ship in Question had stered a prop
Course she could not have missed the Pilot i
This Deposition was transmitted by our selle
Committee to the Director & Co. at Hughter to
a further Observation, that the Master of the
when in the English Service made it a comm
Practice to bring in the Vessells he commanded
out taking any Pilot on board, which Circum
made it very probable he had acted in the sam
manner in the present Instance & therefore was to

Scoll had advanced of not seeing the Ship, and in
the latter part of their Letter very peremptorily
informed is, They should proceed against Us
Corformable to the Liews of the Netherlands &
demanded our Appearance or some one authorised
by us to answer to the Charge of the Owners of the
St Anne, before the Judge to whom the Cognizance
of such Matters belonged. The whole amount of the
Damage being valued at 34000 Rupt. This manner
oftreating the Board We esteemed so deragotory
of the Respect due to the Governour & Council of
this Settlement, that We returned their Setter of Depor
sitions without any other Reply than our Sentiment
of their Behaviour, and that as We could not on any
Account look upon our Employers as responsable
for the Jess of the Ship St. Anne, We should wave
all further dispute & Correspondence on that Subject.
Thus ended this Affair, & We hope your Honours
will approve of our Resolution not to admit of any
Claim on the Company for that loss, as it was
owing to no want of Care in 45. The Board having

this Visit has established between the Nabob and the
English. As the Expence We have been at on this
Occasion may appear unnecessary unless the
Advantages apparently overballance the Charge.
He shall point out a few of those Advantages to
your Observation, from which your Honors will We
flatter ourselves concur in Opinion with us of the
Eligibility of getting the Subah to consent to this
Condescensions.
We shall begin by mentioning that
our Enemies had endeavoured to sow the Seeds of
Diffidence in the Nabob's Breast by making him
beleive We were not his real Friends, (that We only
waited for a favourable Opportunity to remove
him & set up another, and so far had this Opinion
prevailed in the Purbar, that most of the Nabobs
Counsellors & his Son in particular were extream.
ly averse to his putting himself in our power by
coming to Calcutta, And had not Mr Watts and
dumirbeg the Shows dar of Hughley taken great pains
to obviate the Impression their Apprehensions had
made on the Nabob, We beleive he would have decline
the Presidents Invitation. Upon his comina
down & meeting with so polite a Reception as he
did, he perceived the Malice of those who had
endeavoures


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0092
90
endeavoured to alary him against the English, and
so nell satisfied with our Behaviour of Deportmen
that he expressed himself in going away in the ille
terms of Friendship & declared he should in fulle
confide in the English even more than in his a
Children.
Another material Consideration
made it necessary to gain the Subahs entire Ce
–dence & Friendship, for Mons: Pally with a bl
Force being arrived on the Coast, Fort St. Paul
taken & an Attack daily expected on the Bell
of Madrass, the event of which might have beled
unfavourable to Uss, It was not to be doubted
Monor Sally would attempt to rerestablish the
French in this Kingdom in case he had made
himself Master of the Coast, a great Inducement
such an Attempt would have been the Reporte
were industriously propagated of their being
Cordiality or real good Understanding betwee

Succeeded in making him & his principal Ministers
our Friends, which must totally disappoint any
Expectations our Enemies might have entertained
of being aided by the Government in their Designs
against our Settlements in Bengal
Securing of the Nabob's Confidence &
removing all cause of Sealousy or disgust against the
English was a material Bint & serviceable in many
Respects, as it not only damped the Spirits of the
French, by taking away all hopes of fomenting a
Quanel between the Nabob & Uts, a Circumstance they
eagerly wished for expected) but Arenathed also
our Influence & Consequence in the Country, pre-

py Rupture between the Subah first Minister
Roydoolub, might have been the Occasion of, and
gained Us the Friendship of the new Minister, who
was not confirmed in his Office till the Nabob arrives
in Calcutta & consulted Colonel Clive. We have reason
likewise to think it has been a great means of prov
curing the Sunnud for the Sands to the Southward

our Interest. Many other good Effects it may prod
but We shall close the Subject by observing that it i
absolutely necessary at that time to make the Nabl
our Friend & convince him of our Attachment to
Person & Government, as the Expedition to Golder
(which promised so many Advantages & some
Honour to the English could not have been unde
taken had there been the least Expectation of

thereon; Copy of which letter (the Statements made
by him from the Accounts he reces of the Lemidars, are
transmitted in this Ships Pachell, to which He must
refer your Honors.
N. 29 is a general Abstract of all
the Fergunnahs to the Sr. ward of Calcutta, and points our
in a very Circumstantial manner the Quantity of

Number of Villages, Markell's Lemidars & Farmers,
how much Ground is assigned over to the Pintoo

Mr Frankland an act of, but this remains to be

which ought & must be effected, as the square
in each Bigah differ allmost in every Braunner

of the twenty two Pergunnake to the Steward of
Calcutta, In which is clearly specified the Rents &
Revenues paid the Nabob for the whole; What part
thereof are Impositions laid by the Subahs (which
He are endeavouring to avoid paying and the Nell
Revenue brought to Credit in the Renas Sircany
Books, which be the Treaty is to be paid by the
Company no more. The said acet likewine partin

& Rialts, what is kept in their own Flands, The Sold

Lemidars themselves wrote off did not collect, The

As the Farmers by virtue of the
abovementioned Obligations are to hold their Harms
till the Boneat, or Month of March, We have not an
-yet taken into Consideration in what manner the
Lands shall in future be managed; We think hower
A would be adviseable to put up such Grounds, Towns
Lillages at Outery whose Revenues are pretty near
their real Produce, & to farm them out to the best
Bidder for the Term of one, two or three Years as the see
Convenient. But those Grounds, Towns of Villages as
are gone to decay of do not yield any thing cacial to
what they formerly did or even so much as is paid
for them to the Nabob, must be kept in the Comt
Hands for a little time till be Penity & other Encoura
ments they are made to wield a proportionable
Rent to the Rest of the Sands, which effected they
may be sold in the same manner as the others.
The getting Possession of these Sande
has been attended with a Charge of near 50000 Rups,
as it was necessary for Mr Frankland to carry a great
Retinue (a large number of Servants of all Kinde

As the Farmer of the at Bazar
understood he was to have it on it's usual Termo
when he purchased that Farm. Your present Regulation
being a great prejudice to him. He permitted him
to resign the purchase on his petitioning so to do, &
ordered the Temidar to collect the Pitys in that Buran
for the Company.
It having been thought expedient
for getting a Sufficient Quantity of Chunam for
"the use of our Works to forbid the selling that Article
to private Persons, We permitted the Parmer of
that Article to relinguish As his purchase as he
by Petition to the Board complained of the Hardshe

which had been made subsequent to the sale of
the Farms.

Consultation, Mr Edward Handle purchased t
for the Sum of 1000 evert Rupees of Annum. A

much Prejudice to the Military who were conted
intoxicated with Lauer after the setting up pulled
Shops for the sale of track. We suppressed the re
given. Mr Handler, forbid his distilling or selle

similar to those
you offer to our Consideration Methods pracused

of Tobacco, Corsanut Trees, Beetle brack at this
Settlement, Your Honours mart rely on our
carrying into Execution your Directions as far
as lays in our Power, Lencouraging the planting of
Coccanuts, Beetle & Tobacco. The former He imagine
may by proper management in a Course of years
yield a large Revenue by throwing part of the new
Lands into Plantations of Cocoanuts, which We
shall take under Consideration, & do the best We
can for the Company’s Interest. The Soil of our
Grounds We beleive is not so proper for Beetle and
Tobacco; If the find upon Tryall, that Beeth nutt
Frees may be raised with Advantage, We shall not
fail to plant them, But We are at a great Sols in
what manner to raise the Tobacco Farm to anything
near the Sum it pays the Company at Bombary
Your Honours will find that it was the Opinion of
the Committee appointed to take those Regulations
into Consideration) that it would be proper to

or Salt is brought into the place without part

Your Commands Respecting t

of this once flourishing Colony, which has been t

particulars of Capt. Brohier's Estimates of his

Notwithstanding this Expence

of Bombay had undoubtedly a right to send what

upon the Incorporation of Capt Gouin in the same
light they did, therefore could not without putting
an Affront on the Governor & 6th of Bombay make
any Exceptions to receiving him on our Establishm

Inspection it is now made has taken great Pains
to make the Bourder of equal Quality & Arength
as the Europe, but it will not answer the Proof, not
remain Colerably good above a month or two, wether
this is owing to any Fault in the Materials or in
the Method of making it We cannot pretend to
say, But as it is of the utmost Consequence to the
preservation of the Settlement to have good Gun-
powder, and as We are sensible it will be impossible
to be supplied from Europe with the Quantity We
may be in want of We beg leave to propose to Your

Apparatus of making Gunpowder may be
engaged in the Company’s Service & sent out to
this Presidency, by which means We may probably
be enabled to make that Article of a proper Quali

with such Palaries, Allowances & other Priviledges of
Trade is you may think proper to settle on them
And the are of Opinion it would be usefull if the Depre
:lys to those Offices were likewise filled up from Europe
with Orders to succeed in case of the Death, or Returns
of the leads, as an Occident to the Gentlemen sent
out Secretary & Accomplant would defeat the Design
of their being sent abroad unless others were Masters
enough of the Business of those Offices to succeed
them. We do not by this Paragraph mean to reflect
on the Obilities of your Junior Servants here, or
those who at present fill the Offices, but as it becomes
necessary for the Gentlemen of the Covenanted
List, who doe or man enjoy these Posts to be remod
to Subordinates & bif their natural Rise in the
Service succeed to higher Stations, We have thought
it necessary to recommend it to your Consideration
for Persons to be appointed from England to those
Particular Offices without being liable to change
or the Advantage of Supercedance.

Other Business of Consequence

Mr Pearkes his Conduct at Patna till We were at
more Seisure to consider of that Affair. Upon the
Arrival of the Warren London and the Appointment
of Posts to the Members of the Board, it was agreed
Mr Parkes should go Chief to Puchy poor, but pres

laid against him as before mentioned should be cleared

once a Week in the place of three times which
would interfere too much with the Duties or
their different Posts & Attendance on Councils

obliged to indulge them with the use of a Palanguin
in the hot months & Rains, on account of the dis-

comply with your orders in purchasing the said Goods
if procurable on very reasonable Terms, I shall give them
Bills on your Honours for what moneys they may tender
on acet of Goods sold by them to the Company.
We shall order to be sent home by the
Catter Ships, Copies of all Bills received at Sultak of 500
Rupees & upwards for your Satisfaction
The principal We beleive only
Intention of Those who applied for attested Copies of their
Interest Notes was, that they might send the Originals to
Fort St George or any other place of Security, But as an
accident might have happened to the Ship there were
sèntupon, The Attested Copies would have shewn that
such Bonds did really exist at the time they were ten-
dered to the Board. We shall conformable to your orders
callin the Copies & grant no more in future.
Upon paying the Interest of any
Bond We always did I still continue to endorse off
the Sum paid, specifuences particularly whether it was for
Interest or for part of the principal, Your Honours may

In Consequence of the Orders conte
in the 176 Paragraph of your Setter, dated 3. March,
transmit you in this Packett an Application fro
Mr George Willian son for Parment of the Bond
his name. The Proof he mentions your Honou
observe are as Strong & clear as the nature of suite
an Affair will admit, I We are convinced in Ourall
that the Bond in that young Gentleman’s name
not been discharged before the Capture of the Settle
We therefore recommend his leave to your Considere
& doubt not you will be sutished of his Claim of
Company, & direct the amount of the said hone
Interest to be discharged, In like manner the
You Applications from Mr Barthol new Plaid he

universally complained of, and one apparent Reason
for their not being received but with difficulty of Mermen
We took the Reduction of Batta in to our serious Conse
:deration on the 15th May, and after consulting several
Throffs, Podars & Merchants, came to a Determination
to fix the Batta of Current Piccan at 16 plots better than
Current Rupees and of Sunnauts at 11 p2. All other
Rupees were to be esteemed a Merchandize of the
Batta of them to fluctuate as the Buzar rose or fell.
But for the Conveniency of those who had any three
Sun Picas (the last Years) We agreed to receive them
in the Treasury at 13p Cent, as it would have been rather
a gain than a Poss to the Company, the 3. Suns being
at many durings of equal value with the four
Suns or new Siccas
You will observe by the face of that
Pay’s Consultation, that the Board agreed to call
in all Ticeas that had been corned in our Mint &
issued out of the Treasury for payment, our reasons
for so doing you will find entered at large in that
Consultation, & We flatter ourselves the Justice of
our Proceeding will be acknowledged & approveday
by your Honours.

to us that the Company would not pay it to
case Mr Douglas received it: That Gentlemand
of the Transaction, & the Assurance Omichund
us that he had sent the Calcutta Sicas, which
received from Mr. Douglass to Muxadavad
–fied Us that the Company had not been chard
"with the difference of batter on that Sum, and
would have been a great Hardship on Mr Dou
to have lost that Benefit which every body else
received, We agreed to make it good to him in the
same manner as it had been paid to others:

the Company responsable for the Consequences, We
have therefore refused to pay that Demand.
Inorder to avoid if possible the
Charges of a Law Suit We agreed to leave it to the
Decision of four Arbitrators to determine if the
Company were liable to pay the Owners of Ship
Restitution the Sum she was indemnifyed for
That the Arbitrators not being able to settle it, Capt
Durand has commenced a Prosecution in the Mai
ors Court for the Recovery thereof
Enclosed are Copies of Capt Durand
Letters Your Answers on the Occasion for your Obser
vation.
In reply to the 169. Paragraph of your
Commands of the 3 March, We beg leave to acquaint
You We have examined the Affair of Ship Toddale
He think the payment for that Thip’s Cotton might
have admitted of dispute before the battle of Place, but
that now it will admit of none, as due regard was had
thereto in estimating the Company’s Posses & restitute
on thereon included in the Grove of Rupees. The
Company have besides had Credit for a part of the
Doddalay’s Cotton found in the Fort a 25 at per Maine
whereas the Owners were only allowed 20 O. for House

by the Company; It does not appear to us that he
the whole of this Transaction there was the least
or Intention of Fraud or any other Circumstand
that can possibly reflect the least Dishonour on
Owners of the said Shipt,
The Transaction mentioned into
170th Paragraph of your said Commands was litte
taken into Consideration, and it appearing not on
by the Sub Treasurer’s Deposition, but also by M
Manninaham & Frankland's Bengal Cash 1
The Podar’s Memorandums Gother Evidence the
Messrs Manningham & Frankland could be t
ways interested in this Fransaction, That the
money was actually paid into the Treasurip
Bill of Exchange before Advice had of the Sol
Cassimburar or march of the Nabob's Army be
Calcutta, We are of Opinion the Honible Compet
became accountable for this Sumi that the B
acted with propriety in granting a Bond f
same to those Gentlemen and that this Demet
made the 6th August 1756 cannot be deemed at th
Thought in Mr Frankland with Intention

of Calcutta in June 1756. Who delivered in the 19 June.
An Abstract of the Sums they had established for such
Persons as had tendered them their accounts to be
examined, Which Abstract was confirmed on that
Day, and a Dividend of four annoes in the Rupee
ordered to be paid the respective Sufferers out of the
Money at that time received from the Nabob on their
Account. This Dividend was paying out of the
Treasury when a Pelition was presented is from
several of the black Inhabitants complaining of
having recorded great Injustice from the Comme
sioners in passing their accounts & intimating that
their own accounts & those belonging to their Friends
& Relations had been partially examined, In order
to trace out if this Complaint was well founded or
not, He ordered Mets Rider, Johnstone & Senior
to enquire what Grounds the Complainants had
for their Allegation against the Commissioners
o if there appeared any mal-practise on the part
of the latter, Their Report is intered after our Consul-
utation of the 10th Aughy charges the black Commission
"ners with many irregular funjust proceedings, par
dicularly that they had curtailed the bulk of

Estimates laid before them in a much greater
-portion than they had their own or those of the
Friends & Relations. The Commissioners have
desired leave to justify themselves from the Cle
laid against them, We permitted them to give into
Reply which is likewise entered after our Consulte
& a second Setter from Mess: Rider Johnstone
is entered after our Proceedings of the 10 September
Support of their Charge. As We had not leisure
selves to undertake a minute Scrutiny into the
of the Commissioners in order to be satisfied

own accounts, We requested the Gentlemen commit

May it please your Honors
Enclosed we transmit You a
letter designed to have been sent by the Warren
via Madras, but the news which the select
Committee have communicated to us of the
situation of that Place, has obliged us to alter
our plan of disposing of your ships, which we
have now stationed as follows; the Worcester
proceeds directly for Europe with about elever
hundred bates, the Prince George will follow
her with much the same quantity and the
Bombay Castle, or the Hardwicke, if she
arrives in time will carry the remainder of
our Investments for which purpose we have
countermanded our orders for her being en
to the West Coast, and have directed Col.
Forde to dispatch her to us as soon as she
can be spared. The Warren was dispatched
to Madras the 5th Inst, but as she had a
considerable sum in Bullion and Gold on
Board we had


BL_IOR_E_4_24_0234
on board we have judged it most prudent
unlade the bales which were shipped to
the receipt of the take advices and havell
it to the Gentlemen of Madras either to
dispatch her home this season or keep the
in India another year as they may fill
most convenients. In case the Hardw
returns in time to be dispatched home
season the Bombay Castle will proceed
Madras and from thence to Vizagapather
if it be thought necessary to keep a ship
The Board having apported
Mr Holwell to the Import Warehouse
of the Posts destined for him by your to
when I for appointed the rotation of foll
Presidents, we have though to proper 18
him the salary then annexed by your

recommend to your Honor the contient
of the same salaries to the Successors of t
four Poste distinguished in your Letter
3 March 1758 and particularly that the
salaries of the Land Custom Master at
the Collector of the Revenues be equite

the to 1.
our Homble Master's Letter of the 12. May
1750 that the said Company was raised
entirely at Can Delaval’s expence, we were
of opinion it was but equitable to confer it
on his Brother who was an Officer in the
Guards and a Captain in Lord Effinghams
Regiment and who from the universal 9000
character he bears as a soldier and a Gentle
we have reason to think will be a credit to
our corps, and of Service to our employers,
We therefore agreed to give him a Commis-

no prejudice to the other Officers on our
establishments as it is equal to them
whether the present Gentleman or the
deceased Capt Delaval had the Command
of that Company

to think that the Danes have supplied our ene

Employers and in support of our own judgin

under the disagreeable necessity of speaking
again to this subject and that your Honor
may the more easily investigate this trans-
-action, we beg leave to lay before you in one
view the following state of the case from which
we are apprehensive we shall rather incur
your displeasure in having proceeded against
Mr Pearkes with too much lenity, in place of
the severity that Gentleman complains of

soon after Mr Pearkess arrival there he alled
the Board under date the 22 July that two othe
–tial Merchants of Patna woud contract
the Company to deliver between to 830 0000
Betre in Calcutta at Sa2 clear of all charge
whatever. The Board observing the Shield
be cheaper on these terms than the Count to
had received for many years assented to the
contract being made with the above held
Mr Pearkes again advises the Board the
had actually made the Contract with the
Merchants and subsequently forwards to
-cutta 5000 More of Petre as part of the said
as appears from Extracts of his severall
now transmitted to your Honors under the
the 12th a 18 July 1757 the is t0 Aug. the 1 d
Sept. the 26th there at Deck 1788 throug
this series of letters Mr Pearkes allude

without ever once mentioning himself to

aplea he has taken up only since the old
of his Conduct.
The Board conceiving cause
recalling Mr Pearkes from Ratna Mr M
was appointed to succeed him who trans at the

the Companies Carconnahs at Singhy and
Chuprah to his own use, which charge the Gover
nour laid before the Board in consultation the
7th Sep. 1758 and Mr Pearkes was directed to give
a satisfactory unswer to the charge
Mr Pearkes put in his reply
the 14 sess in Council which with his first
aodress to your Honors went by the ships of that
season, without any further scrutiny or animad
-versions from the Board occasioned by the variety
of matters before them of more important conse
-quences, but when the Posts and Chiefships
came under consideration after the arrival of
the Ships London & Warren we thought it incum
bent on us to resume the inquiry into this trans-
-action before any Post of trust was committed
to Mr Pearkes his conduct,
Accordingly the Board appoin
ted Mess Mackette Boddam & Scrafton a Commit
dee of facts, who deliverd their report to us the
Decemn, and which was entered in the Consulta
-tion of that day
The report of the Committee being
read in Council the 7 of Lee Mr Pearkes was
interrogated to the several matters of the charge
and particularly to nominate the two Merchan
with whom he had made the Contract on behalf
of the Company which he evaded several time
asserting

in
asserting notwithstanding that there world
Merchants and that he would nominate the
if the Board woud give him time the in mad
contradiction to the plea he had before use
himself being the Contractor, but being fill
pressed on this head he once named Mheir
abone of them but afterwarder retracted the
nomination and now in his almost uninth
–gible address to your Honor of the 27 Delt
declares that Moonholl the Dutch Chiefs
-ian and Major Coote were the two Merchat
mentioned in his letters to the Board.
In Concomess to Mr Pearke
omitted giving our sentiments in Consultat
on the latter part of Mr Amyulls Charge told
the Company’s Carconnahs at Chupiah and
Singhy which he now forces from us, his for
that those Carconnatu could not be worth
they were refreshed with Cutcha Petre catt
we think answer any purpose in his of the
nor vindicate his converting such refresh
to his own use: He think Mr Pearkers th
parity of reason seize his Neighbours that
to his own enrolument because it lies unded
but what will be your Honors further cond
where you find Mr Pearkes confesses in the
examination before the Committee that the

was part of the Petre sent down to us on the
fictitious contract with the two Merchants at
5.27.
On the whole Mr Pearkes appears
to us as having from first to last imposed two
Merchants upon the Board who did not exist
whilst himself was covertly the Contractor, that
he purchased the Petre at 3. A. 7. Mr which he In
-voiced at 5.2 3M to the Company and that he
unjustly converted their Carconnates to his own
use and Profit, rendering himself thereby in our
iuogments guilty of a Breach of that trustrinese
in him by the Board, to whom his conduct applies
unfaithfull, collusive, and disengenuous and in
consequence we thought it indispensibly our
duty to suspend him from our Councils till now
Honors pleasure be known.

The Expedition to Decean has suc

over the French army under the Command of the
Marquis De Conflans consisting of five hundred
Europeans 98000 scupoys with Europe arms
with very little loss on our side e5 of the French
were kitted & 70 taken prisoners exclusive of fourte
Officers, He has also taken their Camp fall their
Artitlery consisting of 36 pieces of Cannon with
proportionable Ammunition, By letters from M
Andrews since the Action We learn that the Ma
quis DeConflans had Collected together the Shaller’s
remains of his army yivas encamped near t

of Rajamundrum a very strong, fortified less the
croded the River hista in pursuit of the Enemy be
that his progress had been retarded by a dispute
with the rajah which is since accommodated an
they are marched together against Masselitation
We have great Reason to think the punch do note

soon make himself master of it which with

not only maintained their Army but admill

Mr Teddy mans squadron with the thing men or
at least the disappointment of the Enemy
In our last address we flattered on
selves the should be able to make head against our
Enemys on every side though superior but we did
not then conceive the french would have made sin
extroardinary Offects, or that the should have been
so poorly supported, or to speak more properly so
Abandoned - By letters taken in Mons? De Conflat
Camp, We learn the Arrival of a third division at
the Islands of three Kings & seven Company’s Sup
Commanded by Mons. Targritte the number of
Troops already landed by Mons. Lally have exceed
ed 3000 He cannot suppose the third division to
have brought less then half the Number, & the
whole number of men landed at Madrass since
the War has not reached to 300 Yet we presum
the preperations of our Enemy have been no secl
in England, we are sorry it is our fate to Con
test against such unequal numbers but your
honors may be assured of our exerting ourselves
to the utmost of our posser & Abilities. He have
directed Colonel Forde that should he have a
prospect of immediate Success against Massu
hipatam to prosecute the serge with vigor &
he has the Good fortune to take it that he destro
the fortifications & proceed immediately to the
Assistance of fort St George We have also sent to these
Assistance the Company of the Kings troops that

hope the India men at least will be mill

At the time of the dispatch of

Our last address waited on you be
the Worcester under date the 8th Alto wherein you
were acquainted of the Necessity for the Residen
with the forces to take the field and accompany the
Nabob to the Northward in order to prevent and
ill Consequences from the arrival of the Kings
Son at Banarras. It was the 1. Instant ther par
out from hence & the 14th they marched from the
adavad Northward, Our last advices from them
mention the Kings Son and part of his force
having crossed the Caramassa) which Rive
is the boundary of our Rovinces (and the
Ramnarrain with his forces were encampai
Fulter Baag where he was throwing up ention
-ments & erecting Batteries for his better detent
against the Kings Son, Ramnarrain had al
summoned the Baudgepore Rajaks and the
Zemindaars to attend him with their Troop
We have no certain account of the Number
Forces with the Kings Son, but believe the
are not very considerable. All Letters from
Delky have been siezed in the Kings Sone
Camp, and torn, but it is confidently asser
-ed the King and Vizier are on their mare
after the Kings Son, and are so particular a

she might proceed to Massalipatam, but it being

sending her Back, but lapt. Samson having in our
opinion distresse the service he was employed on by
quitting his Station and coming down to Bengal
without Orders by which melins the Ship Handwich
was renders useless to the Company, He thought pro
per to dismiss her from the Service, till the had
further use for her and protested against Captain
Samson for all ill consequences & losses that might
accrue to our Employers from his proceeding in
this Manner but finding shortly after that she
would be wanted for a September ship of that
the Charge of unloading her saltpete would
be very Considerable He thought proper to alter
our Revolution on this Occasion.
Some time in February We sent the
Fanny snow to the Negraise & directed Mr Newton
to embark on her of repair here with his Garrison
of Military Stores leaving only a serjeant of three
or four Men to take care of the Companys timbers
In consequence of those Orders Mr. Neroton arrived

that the detention of that ship by Col. Force had
prevented her returning, to Bengal in time to be
employed on any other toyage from this place by,
which means the talue of the Block was re
duced from fifty thousand Rupees the price the

it would be impossible to make the whole advance

In consequence of the Directions
very little falls within the Province of the Select Comm

most of the transactions here.
2
The Contests which have alware
subsisted between the Kings and Company’s the
–tary, and the independence of the former on your law
nors and Counals have been very detrimental to the
common cause, We therefore looks upon the sending
Major Calliauds with a detachment of Companie
Troops from Madrass to have been a well media
Step of that Presidency, and We really believe for
the foregoing Reason, more Benefit will and
from them to the Publick, than if his Mareships
regiment with Colonel Coote had been sent.
The source and event of our disput
with the Dutch having been explaind to you in th
general letter: We shall only observe that had the
Dutch succeeded, and been allowed to keepin the
Country the considerable reinforcement sent the
from Batavia, there would have been an end or
Your Influence & future expectations in these

us, would of course be involved in a scene of distry
terrible to think of The Nabob during the whol
this affair discovered a Coolness, which gives it
much reason to conclude that he would not had
been sorry the Dutch had so far succeeded as on
a Ballance of Beer between them and us that by
that means he might be less dependent, and it
certain he never appeared strenuous in our
till by our extraordinary and speedy success, to
found the Dutch were in no condition to sup
a rivalty against us, from hence We have aft
demonstration how little dependence is to be he
on the Friendship of the Country Goverment
but while We have such a Force as can oblig
them to maintain it.
It is necessary to inform you the
Roydullut whom We have formerly mentioned
you as the principal Instrument in bringing a
the late levolution being a Man of great Power to
immense Health, The Tabob through felousy of t
former and in order to secure to him self the at

to him by the President to withdraw to Madrass, but
this could not be done without losing his Castor

M. Tuche of Forset having suffered

much in the late Action with the Dutch that she could
not be property repaired in time to proceed to Bombat
came to a resolution of stationing the Stormant to that
Presidency in her stead & determind that she should proce

will proceed for Bencoolen in a few days with 3000
of Salt Petre in order to be filled up with Pepper of dispe
from thence to your Honors.
The Board taking into Considerate
the Master Attendant’s Report of the Conduct of John
Cheworth the Pylot of the Stretham when she run at
& it appearing that he was unpardonably culpable, We
determind to dismiss him the Company’s service & that to
should proceed to Europe in one of the ships now under to

The Company having a considerall
Battance in their hands due to the European Sufferer
the Capture of Calcutta in June 1756 We agreed to add

that the Powder does not tum out according to our expe

time determend to use every precaution in our power for
the security of it there.
Immediately after the dispatch of the
Calcutta & Hadewick Colonel Clive set out for Muxad

laid before us a letter of the 23rd Ulster entered after that days

Our reply to which will appear in our proceedings of the

The Memonal of Facts with respect

Account.
We shall in future pay a due right
to the 22 Parragraph of your letter of the 23. March
1759 with respect to the Gratuitys to be given the Sean
on any immergency but hope We shall not incur of
displeasure by having rewarded the Seamen and Pott
Officers of the Calcutta Duke of Dorset & Hardwich
their gallant behaviour in the late Action against ther
as the very being of the Settlement in a great measure &
ed on the spirit shewn by them on that occasion.
Althe the then Governor & Countil
may be accused of want of attention to the Company’s or
rest in sending the Directore Council & Inhabitants
Chandemnagore away at so large an expence We could not
have conceived the design itself would have been deemed
political. We know not in what light this Affair me
have been represented at home but to us your Governor
Council as well as to every Inhabitant of Calcutta ite
-pears that if so considerable a Body of French had
been suffered to remain in Bengal it might have quit
encouragement to a much more dangerous attempt the
that lately made by the Dutch in short while there at
any French left to inspire sentiments of their streng
of Abilities to introduce an Armed force to recover their
mer Possessions in these Provinces our Interest simple
must be deministro in the Eyes of the Government at
We apprehend by sending them to Pondicherry they l
not so well circulate any of these Reports so very input
to the affairs of the last India Company We might
further add that if the French were really in a cont
to make an attempt upon Bengat nothing could be t
tikely to insure success than the intelligence and Ar

of executing a Portification at Byrampose The material
which were provided for that purpose have since been
sent down & made use of in the new Citadet.
It has been signified to the Servants
mentioned in the list enclosed in your Pacquet & Prince
Henry that they must write to their Friends to enter ente
such securities for them agreeable to their several ranks
which they have accordingly done by these shins.
In our Address under date the 29 of

the true Interest of the Company to reduce the Garrison
We must beg leave to remark that neither the Troops by the
appointment nor the Artittery or Mitetary stores in genera
we are in pessession of will be adequate to the defence of our
cxtensive Fortifications For the latter Articles we must
refer to Capt. Brothers Indents And as to the former we
are the more solicitous from being convined by the Subake
late conduct during our disputes with the Dutch that no
further faith or confidence is to be placed in this Government
but what a respectable force can exact from them.
As soon as Capt: Fischer returns with
his party we shall as much as in our power reduce the
heavy charge of the Scapoys by discharging as many as
the service will admit of and as the conveyances by sea
have miscarried & we have thereby been disappointed of

the sums already expended and Work done, it is no
